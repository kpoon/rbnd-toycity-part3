1) How long did you spend working on this project?
About 8 hours.

2) What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Learning how to create and use classes and objects.  There were times I did not know in which class I should create a method.  Also the ease of writing code with Ruby.  Several times I didn’t know where to start but I “think” it should work this way and it does!

3) What two additional features did you build? Why?
Feature #1 - More details about customers
Because we only had the customer’s name.  Would help to know their age and sex.  As a business it always helps to understand the customer base.

Feature #2 - Added purchase date
We only had the customer and product that was purchased.  Would help to know when the purchase was made.  

4) Where do you still have room to grow?
I still have a lot of Ruby to learn!
